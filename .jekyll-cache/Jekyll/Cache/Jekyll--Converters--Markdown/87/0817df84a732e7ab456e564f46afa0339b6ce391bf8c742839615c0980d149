<p>After traveling Europe for 7 months and working online to support myself, I learned a lot about what to look for in a good travel laptop.</p>

<p>But the thing is, it’s pretty hard to nail down the “best travel laptop” since it really depends on your needs.</p>

<p>In this guide, I’m going to break down my top 3 choices and explain why they’re so awesome. I’m also going to outline what you should consider before you buy a travel laptop, and some of the <a href="https://financepond.com/shopping/best-places-to-buy-a-laptop/" target="_blank">best places to buy a good one</a>.</p>

<p>But if you’re just looking for the <a href="https://amzn.to/2LAEeS4" target="_blank">best all around travel laptop</a>, we chose the Lenovo Flex 14.</p>

<p>Our view of an all-around great laptop includes a great price, performance to boot, and a relatively high number of added features. The Lenovo Flex is the best possible example we could find that holds all of these positive traits.</p>

<p>It’s truly amazing what types of stuff Lenovo managed to fit into this beautiful piece of machinery and the specifications in relation to its price are almost outlandish.</p>

<p>Thanks to AMD’s new innovations in processor architecture the Flex 14’s Ryzen 5 3500U brings 4 cores with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/hyper-threading-intel-definition,5746.html" target="_blank">hyperthreading technology</a> to the table, meaning that even at under $600USD you’ll be able to run through rendering or other productivity tasks with ease.</p>

<p>Plus, the chip’s integrated graphics offes performance unheard of from prior generations.</p>

<p>And don’t think that low price point means it’s lacking features, because it’s loaded with them! Packing a beautiful rear folding design and a 14in FHD touchscreen, you can use this handy laptop as a tablet. It even comes included with a touchscreen pen.</p>

<p>Looking at its other internals, it sure isn’t lacking there either. 12GB of speedy <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/pc-life-faqs/what-is-ddr4-ram/" target="_blank">DDR4 system memory</a> is more than enough to handle dozens of Google Chrome tabs. The only piece that might disappoint is the size of the storage.</p>

<p>With 256GB storage, don’t expect to be saving all your family pictures for any prolonged amount of time, but the tradeoff is the blazing quick speeds that the internal NVMe SSD can hit.</p>

<p>If you need the extra storage room, you can always buy an external travel hard drive like the <a href="https://amzn.to/38pbfdG" target="_blank">Western Digital Elements 2TB</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re a graphic designer on the go, an artist abroad, or an executive up and about. No matter what you do or who you are, it’s hard to argue against the fact that the Surface Pro 7 from Microsoft is the top of the line when it comes to productivity.</p>

<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a machine offering the same performance and feature set as the Surface Pro 7. While the specifications are solid, most of what you’re paying for is going to the engineering of this laptop.</p>

<p>To pack that kind of power into a chassis small enough to be considered a standalone tablet really must’ve taken some industry know-how.</p>

<p>With its 10th generation Intel Core i7-1065G7 it is easily the fastest laptop on our list, and while its <a href="https://hexus.net/tech/tech-explained/graphics/19311-the-integrated-graphics-processor-igp/" target="_blank">integrated graphics</a> might not be ready for a match of Rainbow Six: Seige, it’ll serve you just fine watching YouTube or even editing videos.</p>

<p>Alongside that amazing CPU sits 16GB of DDR4 RAM which is a great amount for any computer, laptop or otherwise.</p>

<p>There is one major downside, however, that we could not overlook.</p>

<p>While this laptop does include a touchscreen feature, it does not include a pen, like our All-around pick does.</p>

<p>Luckily, we’ve got you covered! Microsoft does have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2RBIcgZ" target="_blank">Surface Pen available</a> if you’re willing to pay a premium for one. Alternatively, companies like Wacom offer <a href="https://amzn.to/2qBjrqe" target="_blank">Surface Pro compatible touch pens</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re opting for a gaming laptop, it’s probably safe to say you’d like to play a fair amount of games on it.</p>

<p>If gaming was your goal you’re definitely in the right spot, but this laptop can handle as much as you think you can throw at it, and more.</p>

<p>While it lacks the touch screen and 2-in-1 utilities of our other productivity laptops, the thinness of this laptop and the internal components more than make up for it.</p>

<p>Packing an Intel Core i7-8750H with 6 hyperthreaded cores, it’s got the highest core count out of any laptop on our list. With the high core count comes amazing speed in both games a productivity tasks such as video and photo editing.</p>

<p>Plus, as the only laptop on our list with a dedicated GPU, the RTX 2060 inside is ready for 1080p and 1440p 60fps gaming.</p>

<p>The 144Hz IPS Full HD panel ensures you’ll get the best out of your gaming experience as well.</p>

<p>You’ll have some great loading times with the included 512GB NVMe, and with 16GB of DDR4 RAM you can once again open 80 Google Chrome tabs (please don’t).</p>

<p>Oh, and did we mention the full RGB? Now we did.</p>

<p>Sure, you could probably get the same performance out of a <a href="/budget-pcs/600/">$600 desktop gaming PC</a>, but you can’t bring a desktop with you anywhere in the world and game on the go!</p>

<h2 id="which-laptop-best-suits-your-needs">Which Laptop Best Suits Your Needs?</h2>

<p>I used my laptop everywhere I went on my 7 month trip through Europe and Asia. It is lightweight, portable, and pretty powerful.</p>

<p>However, since it uses such powerful components, the battery life is less than ideal. Since I usually used it in a cafe with an outlet readily available at all times, this wasn’t an issue for me.</p>

<p>But if you’re not always able to charge, a laptop with a long-lasting battery is going to be important for you.</p>

<p>It’s pretty hard to say one laptop is “the best for travel” because everyone has different needs. The real question is, which laptop best suits YOUR needs?</p>

<h3 id="what-are-you-using-your-laptop-for">What are you using your laptop for?</h3>

<p>Unless you’re using your laptop for online work which requires a lot of processing power, you don’t need to go all out on a high-end laptop. That’s why our overall top pick isn’t very pricey.</p>

<p>Spending two grand on a new laptop may seem like a great idea, but that money would be better spent elsewhere. You’d be surprised how far $2,000 gets you in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>You can definitely get away with a Chromebook on the road if you just need to browse the web, process word documents, and stream Netflix.</p>

<p>Only digital nomads that are working remotely need more powerful laptops, and even then a high performance laptop is only necessary in some cases.</p>

<h3 id="any-size-constraints">Any size constraints?</h3>

<p>If you’re backpacking or just working with limited space, lugging a big bulky laptop around isn’t a great idea. There are so many ultra-thin and lightweight options out there these days, so there’s no excuse to travel with a 10 pound monster.</p>

<p>Some daypacks can’t fit more than a 15-inch laptop in them. Remember that before you make your purchase. Along with screen size, consider the laptop’s weight. A traveler with a heavy backpack is not a happy traveler.</p>

<h2 id="important-specifications-to-consider">Important Specifications to Consider</h2>

<p>Before you buy a laptop, you need to determine your non-negotiable features, minimum performance requirements, and the absolute highest amount of money you can spend.</p>

<p>Often you’ll need to balance out these three key factors when looking for the best laptop for you.</p>

<p>For example, you may have to have a 1080p resolution display with a touch screen and stylus so you can draw on the go. Or you may need a quad-core CPU so you can render videos on the go.</p>

<p>Figure out what you need in your laptop, and find one that satisfies your needs within your budget.</p>

<h3 id="1-price">1. Price</h3>

<p>Of course, price is the first and most important factor to consider before you buy.</p>

<p>Unless you need a high-performance laptop, don’t shell out thousands of dollars for a top-of-the-line model. There are plenty of cheap and lightweight options that’ll get the job done without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>I’d recommend you determine your budget before you begin looking for a laptop, and understand that you may need to make some performance sacrifices if your number is too low.</p>

<h3 id="2-mobility">2. Mobility</h3>

<p>If you’re an on-the-go, minimalistic traveler, mobility is another huge factor. You wouldn’t lug a heavy brick around in your backpack, so don’t lug a 10 lb laptop around either!</p>

<p>You want something that’s small, light, and thin so it doesn’t weigh you down and fits in your day bag.</p>

<p>Luckily, laptops are getting both smaller and faster these days, so it shouldn’t be hard to find a good option in this department.</p>

<h3 id="3-battery">3. Battery</h3>

<p>Another big one is battery life - if you think you’ll be in coffee shops or coworking spaces all the time, this may not be a huge deal as you’ll always be able to charge up.</p>

<p>Conversely, for those always on the move or without immediate access to electricity all the time, a laptop with superb battery life is a must.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that smaller, thinner laptops tend to have smaller batteries, and they’ll drain even faster if the laptop has a lot of power hungry components.</p>

<p>This is especially the case if you’re using your laptop to perform demanding tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-power">4. Power</h3>

<p>If you’re running demanding programs like Photoshop or Adobe Premier Pro, a high-performance laptop is a must.</p>

<p>The CPU is the brain of your computer, so make sure to get a beefy CPU if you need a lot of power. You can’t go wrong with a quad-core i5 or i7 CPU, and don’t forget about AMD’s new Ryzen 5/Ryzen 7 CPUs.</p>

<p>Anything older/less powerful is fine for web browsing.</p>

<p>What’s the bottom line here?</p>

<p>Make sure you get the right CPU for the job. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-buying-guide,5643.html" target="_blank">This</a> guide from Tom’s Hardware will teach you how to buy the right CPU for your needs.</p>

<p>In terms of graphics, you can usually get away with an integrated graphics chips. However, graphic designers and gamers may need a dedicated graphics chip to handle their workload.</p>

<h3 id="5-storage">5. Storage</h3>

<p>Most travel laptops are lacking in the storage department, especially those with longer battery life.</p>

<p>If you’re the type to take a lot of travel photos and videos, the importance of having ample storage cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>I’d highly recommend going for a laptop with an SSD as opposed to an HDD (mechanical hard drive). They’re much faster and use less power as well.</p>

<p>Seriously, mechanical hard drives suck. They make your computer boot super slow, and are often the cause of your computer freezing.</p>

<p>SSDs are much faster on all fronts and worth the extra money. You can always store your extra photos/files on an external portable drive or on the cloud.</p>
