<p>I was messing around with my gaming PC‚Äôs drive bay today and thought ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if I had a hot swappable case for my hard drives?‚Äù</p>

<p>Shortly after, I started doing some research, trying to find a case that supported hot swappable hard drives.</p>

<p>To my dismay, there wasn‚Äôt much information out there.</p>

<p>Plenty of forums and YouTube videos covered <a href="/pc-cases/nas/">NAS hot swap cases</a>, but I don‚Äôt want to build a NAS.</p>

<p>Instead, I just want a hot swap feature for my regular gaming PC case.</p>

<p>After doing tons of research online, I finally figured it out:</p>

<p><strong>There aren‚Äôt any genuine PC gaming cases on the market that offer a hot swap feature (at least that I could find) but there are hot swap adapters that you can install in almost any PC gaming case, for both 2.5‚Äù and 3.5‚Äù hard drives.</strong></p>

<p>In this article, we‚Äôre going to take a look at the 3 best hot swappable case options for you in 2020, including the cases I‚Äôd use and the hot swap drive bays.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-hot-swapping">What is Hot Swapping?</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload" alt="hot swapping" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/hot-swapping.jpg" /></p>

<p>Hot swapping is a configuration that allows you to remove and install hardware while your machine is running.</p>

<p>Instead of having to turn off your PC, open your case, unscrew your hard drive bay, disconnect your cables, etc. hot swapping makes things way easier.</p>

<p>You can install a hot swappable adapter in your case one time, and connect SATA data and power cables.</p>

<p>Next, simply slide your hard drives into place until you hear a ‚Äòclick‚Äô, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>Not hot swapping is like having to turn off your phone before you can remove your headphones and then turning it back on again.</p>

<p>That would be ridiculous!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-hot-swapping-work">How Does Hot Swapping Work?</h2>

<p>This video from Linus Tech Tips will explain how hot swapping works:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-hot-swapping-guide">How to Use This Hot Swapping Guide</h2>

<p>Since I couldn‚Äôt find any traditional cases with a hot swap feature, I had to find hot swappable adapters and compatible cases.</p>

<p>Some adapters are meant for 3.5‚Äù drives, while others are meant for 2.5‚Äù drives.</p>

<p>That being said, I‚Äôve organized this guide in two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3.5‚Äù hot swap drive cage</li>
  <li>2.5‚Äù hot swap drive cage</li>
</ul>

<p>Each section has a featured hot swap drive cage, along with a few cases that you can use.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The hot swap drive cages can be used with any compatible case, but not all cases are compatible. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve selected some cases for you already that are compatible.**</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps!</p>

<h2 id="hot-swappable-drive-cages">Hot Swappable Drive Cages</h2>

<p>You can‚Äôt buy a prebuilt hot swappable case without buying a NAS, but you can buy a hot swappable drive cage and install it in a compatible case.</p>

<p>I went ahead and researched the best options for you.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I found:</p>

<h3 id="35-hot-swappable-drive-cage"><a href="https://amzn.to/2TSRI0g" target="_blank">3.5‚Äù Hot Swappable Drive Cage</a></h3>
<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="3.5 drive bay hot swappable cage" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/startech-35-drives.jpg" /></p>

<p>The StarTech 4 Drive Hot Swap SATA Backplane (HSB4SATSASBA) is the hot swappable drive cage I‚Äôd choose for 3.5‚Äù mechanical hard drives.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs rugged, easy-to-use, compatible with all drives, and is going for an absolute steal on <a href="https://amzn.to/2TSRI0g" target="_blank">Amazon</a> right now (not to mention the great reviews).</p>

<p>This thing can fit up to four mechanical hard drives, and is compatible with 6Gbps SATA III, meaning your drives will be running at peak efficiency.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs compatible with any case that has at least three 5.25‚Äù drive bays (it‚Äôs going to take up all three of them).</p>

<p>Assuming your PC case has three 5.25‚Äù bays (see below) you can turn it into a hot swappable case.</p>

<p>Moreover, unlike the SSD model below, you don‚Äôt need to screw your hard drives into the drive trays.</p>

<p>Instead, they just pop right out of the case. Pretty dope!</p>

<p>In addition, this thing comes with a built-in fan to keep your drives cool.</p>

<p>If that‚Äôs not enough, the manufacturer also offers a 2-year warranty plus lifetime technical support.</p>

<h3 id="hot-swappable-drive-cage-for-ssds"><a href="https://amzn.to/2QgAK9R" target="_blank">Hot Swappable Drive Cage for SSDs</a></h3>
<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="4 hot swappable ssd drive cage" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/4-drive-ssds.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2QgAK9R" target="_blank">ICY DOCK Tough Armor Drive Bay</a> (model number MB882SP-1S-2B) is going to be your best bet if you want to hot swap 2.5‚Äù solid state drives.</p>

<p>This bad boy is nearly indestructible (the company ran it over with a car without causing any damage) and is pretty easy to use.</p>

<p>It mounts in a standard 5.25‚Äù bay which most <a href="/pc-cases/">PC cases</a> have these days, and can fit up to four hot swappable solid state drives.</p>

<p>Four drives in a single 5.25‚Äù drive bay isn‚Äôt too shabby, huh?</p>

<p>You can easily pop the drive bays out, screw your 2.5‚Äù SSD into the removable tray, and pop it into the drive bay.</p>

<p>In addition, this bad boy ships with its own set of daul 40mm cooling fans, which only activate when a drive is installed.</p>

<p>You should note, however, that the cooling fans do tend to run a bit loud, so you may want to invest in a soundproof case.</p>

<p>In addition, the SSDs performed nearly identical to their performance in a normal configuration, meaning performance isn‚Äôt lost when using this hot swappable drive bay.</p>

<div class="vid-container">

</div>

<p>Simply screw it in to your 5.25‚Äù bay, pop your SSDs in there, and you‚Äôre good to go.</p>

<p>Once the 5.25‚Äù drive bay is mounted, you can connect your traditional SATA cables to the back.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great option if you want to have a hot swappable 2.5‚Äù SATA SSD drive bay in your PC case without having to buy a NAS.</p>

<h2 id="compatible-pc-cases">Compatible PC Cases</h2>

<p>These are the PC cases I‚Äôd recommend for use with the hot swappable drive bays listed above.</p>

<p>Note that these aren‚Äôt the only cases you can use, but they are compatible with the hot swappable cages listed above.</p>

<h3 id="corsair-750d-atx-full-tower-case"><a href="https://amzn.to/33l8Yhz" target="_blank">Corsair 750D ATX Full Tower Case</a></h3>
<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="3.5 drive bay hot swappable case" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/corsair-750d.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you want to use the 3.5‚Äù hard drive bay that fits up to four hard drives, the <a href="https://amzn.to/33l8Yhz" target="_blank">Corsair 750D Airflow Edition</a> is a great option.</p>

<p>This case is compatible with both the 3.5‚Äù drive cage and the 2.5‚Äù SSD drive cage.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs definitely bigger than most cases considering it‚Äôs a full tower.</p>

<p>However, considering the drive cage needs three 5.25‚Äù bays for installation, you‚Äôre going to need a big case.</p>

<p>But keep in mind, this thing has a lot more to offer.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre going to get a good looking, robust case with terrific airflow, insanely good <a href="/pc-cases/cable-management/">cable management</a>, plenty of room inside, and a nice side panel window.</p>

<p>This monster is best suited for an enthusiast build, since it has support for a crap load of drives, all of the different cooling options you could imagine, and several large graphics cards.</p>

<p>But I figure you‚Äôre going all out with your PC if you‚Äôre planning on buying a hot swappable drive bay, so it‚Äôs a good fit.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a dirt cheap case by any means, but the value you‚Äôre getting out of it is insane, especially considering its current price <a href="https://amzn.to/33l8Yhz" target="_blank">on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>And if you do order it on Amazon, it‚Äôll come with free 2-day Prime shipping, which you probably couldn‚Äôt get if you bought such a big case elsewhere.</p>

<p>However, if you want a cheaper case, check out the one below.</p>

<h3 id="budget-case-thermaltake-versa-h21-spcc"><a href="https://amzn.to/38LNzPO" target="_blank">Budget Case: Thermaltake Versa H21 SPCC</a></h3>
<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="thermaltake versa h21 budget hot swappable case" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/thermaltake-versa-h21.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre on a tighter budget, the Thermaltake Versa H21 SPCC is way cheaper on <a href="https://amzn.to/38LNzPO" target="_blank">Amazon</a> than the Corsair 750D, and is also compatible with the 3.5‚Äù hard drive hot swap cage.</p>

<p>This case is compatible with the 3.5‚Äù drive cage and the 2.5‚Äù cage.</p>

<p>However, if you‚Äôre on a budget, I don‚Äôt really see why you‚Äôd want to shell out the extra money for one of these anyway, but the option is there.</p>

<p>This thing has pretty good reviews on Amazon, but as you‚Äôd expect from a cheap case, doesn‚Äôt have any crazy features.</p>

<p>It is solid black and doesn‚Äôt have a side panel window. It also only includes a single 120mm cooling fan. Pretty barebones if you ask me.</p>

<p>But it <em>does</em> have three 5.25‚Äù drive bays which you can use to mount your hot swappable 3.5‚Äù backplane.</p>

<h3 id="fractal-design-focus-g"><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ub6tKq" target="_blank">Fractal Design Focus G</a></h3>
<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="fractal design focus g" data-src="/img/cases/hot-swap/focus-g.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ub6tKq" target="_blank">Focus G by Fractal Design</a> is a great case all-around, but is especially a good pick if you want to hot hot swap your hard drives.</p>

<p>This case only has two 5.25‚Äù drive bays, which means it is only compatible with the hot swappable SSD drive cage.</p>

<p>The 3.5‚Äù hot swappable cage requires three 5.25‚Äù bays, so if you want to hot swap your mechanical drives, you‚Äôll need one of the cases above.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll be able to install your hot swappable drive bay with ease, and still have room for an optical drive too.</p>

<p>This case has some awesoem features too, including the powerful stock fans, spacious interior, sleek design, and the side panel window.</p>

<p>All in all, it‚Äôs a great choice, especially if you pick it up on <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ub6tKq" target="_blank">Amazon</a> with free shipping.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a video of a dude hot swapping his mechanical hard drives while his PC is running!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs using them as gigantic floppy disks.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs almost impossible to find a regular PC case that supports hot swapping your drives.</p>

<p>If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, buying a NAS case is probably a better option (we have a guide on NAS cases <a href="/pc-cases/nas/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>However, you can buy a hot swap cage and install it in your regular PC gaming case, which is probably the best option for traditional builders.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
